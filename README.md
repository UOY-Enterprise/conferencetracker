Conference Tracker
=================

Conference tracker is a simple way for groups to keep track of publishing venues such as conferences, workshops and journals. As a back-end it uses a Google spreadsheet. An example of such a spreadsheet can be found here:

To add your own spreadsheet, you should change the 'key' parameter of the Miso.Dataset function in index.html and journals.html.
