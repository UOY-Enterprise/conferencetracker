Conference Tracker
=================

Conference tracker is a simple way for groups to keep track of publishing venues such as conferences, workshops and journals. As a back-end it can use a JSON file or [a Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsDN-wQf9szhdGpjMThxRGVydkVSR1VIWWI0QWtIOHc&usp=drive_web#gid=0).

Install via bower, or by adding `conferencetracker.js` to your website.
